# PROJECT TITLE - Number_Guessing.py

In this project we will know about the programming involed in guessing the numbers .



First we need to consider the range and then include a number .

If the number is considered to be a digit the assign the range with "int" function.

Assuming the number is more or equal to zero then by using "print" give a command of typing a number more than 0 or else print that includes "please type a number next time".
Quit

Now consider , guess 
user_guess = ("make a guess")

now give the same commands to user_guess by including a int and type a number 

if the user_ guess is a random number then the number is right 

elseif the user number > random number , you are above the number 

else if the user_number < random number , you are below the number 

use the same elseif , else statements again 

By using print give the statement " you got the number" , guesses , "gusses"
